# aste-404-project
ASTE-404 Final Project

Code for 1D simulation of a Rotating Detonation Engine
Uses the Forward Time Central Space (FTCS) integration scheme
Solves a system of nonlinear Partial Differential Equations
Models wave energy u(x,t) and reactant mass fraction lambda(x,t)

Python script "ftcs_test.py" for testing functionality and quick plotting
C++ script "ftcs_test.cpp" for production runs and generating animations
Plotting functionality and analysis will be added to c++ version of the code

TODO add analysis & post-processing capability to c++ simulation code
TODO output raw energy and mass fraction plotted data and animation data
in .vti file and in .csv file for python post processing
